      <h3>My First Coding Experience</h3>
      <p>I still remember the first time I wrote a line of code. It was during my SHS days when we were introduced to HTML. At first, I didn’t fully understand what we were doing.</p>
      <p>I just followed along, typing what was on the screen. But when I saved my file and opened it in the browser, I was amazed to see a website that I actually created.</p>
      <p>
    What really got me hooked was the feeling of building something from scratch, even if it was just a simple "Hello World" page. It felt powerful. As I learned more about HTML and CSS, I started experimenting, changing colors, fonts, layouts. I realized how much design and structure matter in making a site look and feel good.

      <h3>The Importance of Friendships in My Life</h3>
      <p>
    Life gets busy and unpredictable, but one thing that keeps me grounded is the presence of good friends. Whether it’s helping me through a tough day or sharing a laugh over something random, my friends play a big role in shaping who I am today.
  </p>
  <p>
    Friendship, for me, is more than just hanging out or chatting online. It’s about having people who genuinely care, who listen without judgment, and who remind you of your worth when you forget. Some friends stay for a season, others for a lifetime, but each one teaches you something valuable.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've had friends who believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself. During moments of self-doubt or stress from school and life, their encouragement kept me moving forward. I've also had friends who challenged me to grow, pushed me to see things differently, and taught me that it’s okay to ask for help.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think the best kind of friendships are the ones where you can be completely yourself, no filters, no pretending. Whether we’re talking about serious things or just laughing at nonsense, it’s comforting to know I don’t have to wear a mask around them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Friendships remind me that I’m never alone. And in a world that can sometimes feel overwhelming or disconnected, that kind of connection is priceless. I’m thankful for the people in my life who stand by me, and I hope I do the same for them.
